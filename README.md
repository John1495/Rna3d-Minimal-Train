# Rna3d-Minimal-Train
Overview
If you sat down to complete a puzzle without knowing what it should look like, you’d have to rely on patterns and logic to piece it together. In the same way, predicting Ribonucleic acid (RNA)’s 3D structure involves using only its sequence to figure out how it folds into the structures that define its function.

In this competition, you’ll develop machine learning models to predict an RNA molecule’s 3D structure from its sequence. The goal is to improve our understanding of biological processes and drive new advancements in medicine and biotechnology.
